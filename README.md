# Infonet HyperText
### Warning
This project has been put on hold for a little while due to the exam period. Be sure to expect a big release around July!
  
## Goal

When I started development, I didn't know anything about coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript...). That's why it took me about a year to make the base version. With the help of many school students, we cleaned up the code, made everything more efficient and implemented some fun features.

We hope this project sparks interest in coding with someone. It's been a fun journey and we hope someone else will make something great when they get inspiration from this project.

## Installation and usage

Download the master branch or release .zip file, extract it to where you want to install it and open index.html. Select any mode or create a new one and you're done.

## Features
Infonet HyperText is highly customizable and adjustable. All code is well documented making for easy learning and customization.
If there's a feature you would like to disable, you can remove it from the code, if there are any problems in doing so, just open an issue and I'll help.
There's also an interactive guide based on 2 projects by [Codrops](https://github.com/codrops). Please note that this is Dutch only!

## Contributing
Currently, we are open for the addition of new features. If you'd like a new feature and we think it fit's the scheme, you can open an issue.
