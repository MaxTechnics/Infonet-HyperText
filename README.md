# Infonet HyperText
  
## Goal

When I started development, I didn't know anything about coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript...). That's why it took me about a year to make the base version. With the help of many school students, we cleaned up the code, made everything more efficient and implemented some fun features.

We hope this project sparks interest in coding with someone. It's been a fun journey and we hope someone else will make something great when they get inspiration from this project.

## Installation and usage

Download the master branch or release .zip file, extract it to where you want to install it and open index.html. Select any mode or create a new one and you're done.

## Modes

You can set multiple parts using the console, or by naturally adding parameters in the URL bar. Here's a quick rundown of the parameters:
- ``?mode=default`` or no parameter: Default mode
- ``?mode=afs1``: April Fools Stage 1
- ``?mode=afs2``: April Fools Stage 2
- ``?mode=xmos``: Chrysostomos Mode
- ``?darkmode=true``: Enable the new Darkmode
- ``?darkmode=false`` or no parameter: Disable Darkmode
- ``?framemode=teacher``: Change the left frame to a teacher focussed address (no page has been made yet)
- ``?framemode=contact``: Change the left frame to a parental contact focussed address (no page has been made yet)

You can combine multiple parameters using ``&``: ``Infonet%20HyperText.html?mode=afs1&darkmode=true``. The order of parameters doesn't matter.

## The all-new menu

If you are using Infonet HyperText in fullscreen or a kiosk, changing settings is now much easier! Just right-click or press space to open the menu.

## Features
Infonet HyperText is highly customizable and adjustable. All code is well documented making for easy learning and customization.
If there's a feature you would like to disable, you can remove it from the code, if there are any problems in doing so, just open an issue and I'll help.
There's also an interactive guide based on 2 projects by [Codrops](https://github.com/codrops). Please note that this is Dutch only!

## Contributing
Currently, we are open for the addition of new features. If you'd like a new feature and we think it fit's the scheme, you can open an issue.
