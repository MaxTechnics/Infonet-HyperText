A billboard like system for schools.

## Installation

Download the .zip file, extract it to where you want to install it and open Infonet Console.html.

## Usage

Open Infonet Console anytime you want, select a mode, watch it work.

## Features
There are many features that might not be needed, you can just open the code and remove the feature to disable it.

Eg. There's a script called HyperTextTheme(); that changes the background depending on the time of day. In the main HTML file, you can disable it by removing it from the <body onload="...."> tag.

Infonet HyperText is highly customizable and adjustable. All code is well documented making for easy learning and customization.

## Contributing
Currently, we are open for the addition of new features. If you'd like a new feature and we think it fit's the theme, we will implement it as good as possible.

## Bugs
We are aware of some bugs that can occur. If you think you found a new one or you can help to fix an existing bug, please open an issue or pull request.

## Problems?
Some problems only occur on 1 browser. Please check the compatibility sheet to check whether your browser is supported. Some had too many unfixable issues so support has been cut.

## Goal

When I started development, I didn't know anything about coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript...). That's why it took me about a year to make this. With the help of many school students, we cleaned up the code and implemented some fun features.

We hope this project sparks interest in coding with someone. It's been a fun journey and we hope someone else will make something great when they get inspiration from this project.
